Problems with the dataset:-
1. Missing values in all 3 datasets  In Zoo Temp Main file there are missing values in Temp column, next  missing values are found in 
Pond dataset again in Temp column.
2. Data are collected for 3 days , however the sample is not equally distributed. 
6/7/2011 has more vlaues, 6/4/2011 and 6/9/2011 have only few values.
3. Data is not normalized, they are unevenly distributed.
4. All the datasets just have date, they don't mention the time when the data was collected, as mentioned in the problem that they change with time.

Section 2 :- New way of organizaing the data

Date| Time   |Depth |  Cuni #/L|	Cuni| ColonySize|	Chippo #/L|	Chippo| ColonySize|	Chla|	Temp|

|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
